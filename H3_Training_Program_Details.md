### 
When submitting an H-3 petition to the U.S. government, particularly to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), it is essential to provide a detailed training program. The H-3 visa is intended for trainees who will receive training that is not available in their home country and that will benefit their career abroad. USCIS requires specific information to ensure that the training program meets their criteria.

While you do not need to provide the entire course content, textbooks, or all lesson plans and assignments, you should include a comprehensive outline and sufficient details to demonstrate the structure and substance of the training program.

Here is a recommended list of what to include in the course program portion of your H-3 petition:

1.  **Detailed Training Program Outline:**
    -   **Objective:** Clearly state the goals and objectives of the training program.
    -   **Duration:** Specify the length of the training program.
    -   **Topics Covered:** Provide a detailed list of topics that will be covered during the training.
    -   **Sequence:** Outline how these topics will be sequenced over time (e.g., weekly or monthly breakdown).
2.  **Training Methods:**
    -   Describe the methods of instruction (e.g., lectures, hands-on practice, observation).
    -   Include information on any practical or on-the-job training components.
3.  **Trainer Qualifications:**
    -   Provide information about who will be conducting the training.
    -   Include qualifications and experience of trainers.
4.  **Materials and Resources:**
    -   List any materials, textbooks, software, or other resources that will be used in the training program.
5.  **Assessment Methods:**
    -   Explain how trainees will be evaluated (e.g., exams, practical assessments, progress reports).
6.  **Schedule:**
    -   Provide a detailed schedule including start and end dates.
    -   Break down into daily or weekly schedules if possible.
7.  **Facilities:**
    -   Describe where the training will take place.
    -   Include information about facilities and equipment available for trainees.
8.  **Supervision:**
    -   Detail how trainees will be supervised throughout their training period.
9.  **Post-Training Plans:**
    -   Explain what opportunities or career advancements are expected for trainees after completing the program.
10.  **Non-Displacement Statement:**
    -   Confirm that U.S. workers are not being displaced by this trainee position.
11.  **Compliance with Regulations:**
    -   Ensure that your program complies with all relevant regulations regarding wages and working conditions for trainees.

By providing this comprehensive information, you can demonstrate to USCIS that your H-3 training program is well-organized, substantive, and beneficial for the trainee’s career development outside of the U.S., thus meeting all necessary requirements for approval.
